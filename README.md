# ChexaAI
Alexa but it knows....

ChatGPT-based Alexa (sorta) webapp, taking advantage of ChatGPT's inference capabilities. Instead of explicitly telling Alexa what to do, ChexaAI can infer and respond by updating states of several appliances.

**Ex:** To Alexa: *Alexa, turn on the lights."*
- To Chexa: *Chexa, it's dark in here.*
- To Chexa: *Chexa, I'm tired.*

**For both situation, lights, at the moment mimicked by LEDs, will be turned off immediately**
